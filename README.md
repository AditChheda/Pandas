# Pandas
This repository contains a collection of my projects and exercises using the Pandas library in Python. 

These projects showcase various data manipulation, analysis, and visualization techniques using Pandas. 
<br> 
Each project is aimed at solving real-world data problems and exploring different datasets.

### Contents

- **Data Cleaning:** Scripts for cleaning and preprocessing raw data.
- **Data Analysis:** Notebooks with exploratory data analysis (EDA) and descriptive statistics.
- **Data Visualization:** Examples of creating insightful visualizations using Pandas and other libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Case Studies:** In-depth case studies on specific datasets, including detailed analysis and insights.
- **Practice Exercises:** Smaller exercises and practice problems to sharpen Pandas skills.

## Project-1

This project demonstrates various fundamental operations using the Pandas library in Python. 
<br>
Below is a detailed list of concepts and operations covered in this project.

### Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about students, including their names, marks, and gender. 
<br>
It is represented in the form of a dictionary with three keys: `Name`, `Marks`, and `Gender`. 
<br>
Each key maps to a list of corresponding values. 

### Concepts and Operations

1. Demonstrates how to initialize a DataFrame using a dictionary.
2. Shows how to retrieve the first few rows of the DataFrame.
3. Shows how to retrieve the last few rows of the DataFrame.
4. Retrieves the dimensions (number of rows and columns) of the DataFrame.
5. Accesses specific rows and columns of the DataFrame.
6. Provides a concise summary of the DataFrame, including data types and non-null values.
7. Identifies null (missing) values within the DataFrame.
8. Counts the number of null values in each column of the DataFrame.
9. Generates descriptive statistics.
10. Extends the description to include categorical data.
11. Extracts unique values from the 'Gender' column.
12. Counts the unique values in the 'Gender' column.
13. Tallies occurrences of unique values within the 'Gender' column.
14. Filters and counts students whose marks fall within the specified range.
15. Computes the average marks of students.
16. Utilizes the `apply` method to perform operations along the axis of the DataFrame.
17. Employs the `map` function for element-wise transformations of a Series.
18. Removes specified column(s) from the DataFrame.
19. Retrieves the column names of the DataFrame.
20. Retrieves the index (row) names of the DataFrame.
21. Sorts the DataFrame based on the 'Marks' column.
22. Sorts the DataFrame based on the 'Marks' and 'Gender' columns.
23. Filters and retrieves the names and marks of female students.
